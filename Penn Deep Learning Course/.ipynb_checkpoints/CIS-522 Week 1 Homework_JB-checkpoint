An example is when AlphaZero defeated the engine Stockfish. The game started with many seemingly unimportant sacrifices that proved to open up the game for AlphaZero, which ultimately led to victory. Many of these moves would not have been made by humans, but were clearly effective in leading to victory.

Especially now, people see the obscurity and beauty of the way advanced algorithms play the game, making moves humans are unlikely to make. However, as mentioned in the article, I do not see the fear that machines will take over. What would be the fun and enjoyment of watching machines play machines w/o every actually play games ourselves? I do see how this could have an impact on young students who are focusing all of the their time and energy only on mastering the game. But maybe this should also make us rethink the way we define mastery and consider the beauty of what humans can do on our own. For example, if I want a new kitchen knife, I can order a blade that has been rolled, stamped, and sharpened by a machine. These might be great, but this certainly does not replace a beautiful damascus steel blade that has been hand-tooled, hand-sharpened and polished, and fit with beautiful, custom handle. Sometimes machine may do it better but they cannot always replace what is added when we include the human spirit.' #@param {type:\"string\"}\n","try:t2;\n","except NameError: t2 = time.time()"],"execution_count":17,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qPX9amdE1iao"},"source":["### The Perfect Match?\n","That was kind of a bummer, huh?

This makes so much sense and is often used in sports as a physical training strategy. If we change the environment in the right way, it can force changes that will benefit us in the original environment. The ethics of the agents is definitely important and does seem to be specific to the game environment. That said, we have to decide if we want to impose human rules on the game's strategy or if we want to allow it to develop completely unrestricted. As with all discussions about humans being replaced, I can't shake the feeling that machines (as of know at least) can't fully harness the human aspect of creation. Yes, they may be able to paint, weld, stack, forge, etc as well or better than humans, but there is something about the way humans do it (perhaps the right amount of flaw) that cannot be replaced, particularly in the creative domain. Unfortunately, I see no chance of traditional factory and warehouse jobs that are repetitive and very programmable to be maintained by humans. \" #@param {type:\"string\"}\n","try:t3;\n","except
