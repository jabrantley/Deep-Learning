Delayed training -- Instead of training on every timestep, we run for 50 steps then train on 50 batches. This allows us to accumulate a better diversity of samples to collect batches from early on. You can see this in the `train` method.\n","2. Exploration -- Recall that in the discrete action case we used epsilon greedy which provided exploration in the form of randomly choosing actions with some small percentage. Since we can't do that here, we will instead add a small amount of noise to the continous action value.

semester, it is possible to safely infer that the adoption and deployment of AI tools have ethical and societal implications. The adoption of standards is one approach that has been largely discussed in the U.S. and globally to deal with these implications and give AI developers and users some guidelines. \n","\n","To have an overview of which standards are being largely considered and their role, we will read [A Plan for Federal Engagement in Developing Technical Standards and Related Tools](https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2019/08/10/ai_standards_fedengagement_plan_9aug2019.pdf) published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology from the Department of Commerce. \n","\n","Read the first excerpt (pages 7-16; PDF pages 9-18) which explains the US approach to standards.  Select one standard that you consider is the most relevant to an application covered in the semester. Offer your analysis of why this standard is important to guarantee the feasibility of this application.\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"cellView":"form","id":"89Iibqfl4kOt"},"source":["important_standard = \"While it is clear how all of the listed standards areas are relevant to technology based on ML and DL, the one that stands out to me is \\\"Societal and ethical considerations\\\". For one, there are no existing standards on the matter, and two, all areas of ML/DL/ and AI in the broader sense have societal and ethical implications. A specific example of this is the use of AI for applicant screening and the effect of bias on hiring and thus economic/social mobility of certain groups (race, gender, class, etc.). A second example is the use of facial recognition for law enforcement. For example, it is well documented that these systems (at least those developed in the US), often struggle to identify black and asian faces. This could have the effect of unfairly targeting certain groups or could lead to incorrect convictions based on faulty evidence, as has been frequently done with visually-inspected fingerprint and bitemark analysis. Standards would provide guidelines for developers and benchmarks could allow new algorithms to be tested for these issues. \" #@param {type:\"string\"}\n","\n","try:t1;\n","except NameError: t1 = time.time()"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3g2Jhgrz3t_3"},"source":["Next, we will read excerpts from [The Chinese Approach to Artificial Intelligence: An Analysis of Policy, Ethics, and Regulation](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3469784) published in the AI & Society Journal of Knowledge, Culture and Communication and [Artificial Intelligence: A European approach to excellence and trust](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/commission-white-paper-artificial-intelligence-feb2020_en.pdf) published by the European Commission. \n","\n","These readings will bring some light into the discussions held in other parts of the world where AI adoption is largely discussed: the European Union and China.

For example,  in the case of medical diagnostics, for better health outcomes for the masses, it is better to ignore individual privacy and mine large amounts of data to determine what is better for many people. This is directly traceable to a utilitarianist way of thinking. On the other hand, increases privacy of individuals may not allow for the 'learning' that can be afforded by surveying the masses, but it does provide greater security and privacy for the individual. In a deontological approach, this is far greater in that it preserves the protection of the individual. I think that the best outcome is a transparent opt-in approach, where large amounts of data can be curated through an opt-in process.
